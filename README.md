In the financial sector, news articles significantly impact stock prices and investor decisions. The challenge lies in the overwhelming volume of news, making it impossible for investors to manually assess whether the sentiment of a report is positive, negative, or neutral in real-time. Misinterpretation of sentiment can lead to poor financial decisions. This project aims to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically classify financial news into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, enabling faster, data-driven decision-making for investors and businesses.
The dataset consists of 4,845 entries and contains two columns:
Sentiment (neutral): This column represents the sentiment label of the financial news, with values such as "neutral," "negative," and "positive." It classifies the sentiment of the corresponding text in each row.
Text: The second column contains financial news or statements. These text entries are used to analyze the sentiment of the news and classify them based on their content.
No missing values are present in the dataset, indicating that both columns are fully populated.
This dataset is structured for sentiment analysis, where the goal is to classify financial news into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we aim to build models that can automatically predict the sentiment of new financial articles.


CONCLUSION
Utilized LSTM combined with word embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe for accurate sentiment classification.
Achieved high accuracy in classifying sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
Performed careful hyperparameter tuning and thorough data preprocessing to optimize model performance.
The insights gained can help stakeholders make informed decisions based on market sentiment.
Potential for real-time sentiment analysis and future improvements to enhance decision-making processes.
